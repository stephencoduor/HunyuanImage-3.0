* 🎨 **Superior Image Generation Performance:** Through rigorous dataset curation and advanced reinforcement learning post-training, we've achieved an optimal balance between semantic accuracy and visual excellence. The model demonstrates exceptional prompt adherence while delivering photorealistic imagery with stunning aesthetic quality and fine-grained details.

* 💭 **Intelligent World-Knowledge Reasoning:** The unified multimodal architecture endows HunyuanImage-3.0 with powerful reasoning capabilities. It leverages its extensive world knowledge to intelligently interpret user intent, automatically elaborating on sparse prompts with contextually appropriate details to produce superior, more complete visual outputs.


## 🛠️ Dependencies and Installation

### 💻 System Requirements

* 🖥️ **Operating System:** Linux
* 🎮 **GPU:** NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
* 💾 **Disk Space:** 170GB for model weights
* 🧠 **GPU Memory:** ≥3×80GB (4×80GB recommended for better performance)

### 📦 Environment Setup

* 🐍 **Python:** 3.12+ (recommended and tested)
* 🔥 **PyTorch:** 2.7.1
* ⚡ **CUDA:** 12.8

### 📥 Install Dependencies

```bash
# 1. First install PyTorch (CUDA 12.8 Version)
pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision==0.22.1 torchaudio==2.7.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# 2. Then install tencentcloud-sdk
pip install -i https://mirrors.tencent.com/pypi/simple/ --upgrade tencentcloud-sdk-python

# 3. Then install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Performance Optimizations

For **up to 3x faster inference**, install these optimizations:

```bash
# FlashAttention for faster attention computation
pip install flash-attn==2.8.3 --no-build-isolation

# FlashInfer for optimized moe inference. v0.3.1 is tested.
pip install flashinfer-python
```
> 💡**Installation Tips:** It is critical that the CUDA version used by PyTorch matches the system's CUDA version. 
> FlashInfer relies on this compatibility when compiling kernels at runtime. Pytorch 2.7.1+cu128 is tested.
> GCC version >=9 is recommended for compiling FlashAttention and FlashInfer.

> ⚡ **Performance Tips:** These optimizations can significantly speed up your inference!

> 💡**Notation:** When FlashInfer is enabled, the first inference may be slower (about 10 minutes) due to kernel compilation. Subsequent inferences on the same machine will be much faster.

## 🚀 Usage

### Deploy with Helm (GPU Clusters)

You can deploy HunyuanImage 3.0 to a Kubernetes cluster with the bundled Helm chart. The defaults mirror the runtime requirements above (CUDA 12.8, PyTorch 2.7.1, and four NVIDIA GPUs by default) and provision a 200Gi persistent volume for model weights.

```bash
# From the repository root
git clone <repo-url> && cd HunyuanImage-3.0
helm install hunyuanimage3 ./helm/hunyuanimage3 -n hunyuan --create-namespace \
  --set image.repository=<your-image> \
  --set image.tag=<tag> \
  --set persistence.storageClass=<storage-class-name>
```

Common overrides:

- Switch to NodePort: `--set service.type=NodePort --set service.nodePort=<port>`
- Adjust GPU requests/limits: `--set resources.requests.nvidia.com/gpu=3 --set resources.limits.nvidia.com/gpu=4`
- Override run_app.sh args/env: `--set args='{bash,/workspace/run_app.sh,--moe-impl,flashinfer}' --set env[0].name=GPUS --set env[0].value="0,1,2"`
- Pull from private registries: `--set imagePullSecrets[0].name=<secret-name>`

After installation, check the service endpoint with `kubectl get svc hunyuanimage3 -n hunyuan` (LoadBalancer) or use the reported NodePort to access the UI.

### 🔥 Quick Start with Transformers

#### 1️⃣ Download model weights

```bash
# Download from HuggingFace and rename the directory.
# Notice that the directory name should not contain dots, which may cause issues when loading using Transformers.
hf download tencent/HunyuanImage-3.0 --local-dir ./HunyuanImage-3
```

#### 2️⃣ Run with Transformers

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load the model
model_id = "./HunyuanImage-3"
# Currently we can not load the model using HF model_id `tencent/HunyuanImage-3.0` directly 
# due to the dot in the name.

kwargs = dict(
    attn_implementation="sdpa",     # Use "flash_attention_2" if FlashAttention is installed
    trust_remote_code=True,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
    moe_impl="eager",   # Use "flashinfer" if FlashInfer is installed
)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, **kwargs)
model.load_tokenizer(model_id)

# generate the image
prompt = "A brown and white dog is running on the grass"
image = model.generate_image(prompt=prompt, stream=True)
image.save("image.png")
```

### 🎨 Interactive Gradio Demo

Launch an interactive web interface for easy text-to-image generation.

#### 1️⃣ Install Gradio

```bash
pip install gradio>=4.21.0
```

#### 2️⃣ Configure Environment

```bash
# Set your model path
export MODEL_ID="path/to/your/model"

# Optional: Configure GPU usage (default: 0,1,2,3)
export GPUS="0,1,2,3"

# Optional: Configure host and port (default: 0.0.0.0:443)
export HOST="0.0.0.0"
export PORT="443"
```

#### 3️⃣ Launch the Web Interface

**Basic Launch:**
```bash
sh run_app.sh
```

**With Performance Optimizations:**
```bash
# Use both optimizations for maximum performance
sh run_app.sh --moe-impl flashinfer --attn-impl flash_attention_2
```

#### 4️⃣ Access the Interface

> 🌐 **Web Interface:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:443` (or your configured port)


### 🐳 Docker Compose

Run the Gradio app in a container built from [`docker/Dockerfile`](./docker/Dockerfile).

1. **Download Model Weights (~170GB)**
   - Save the weights locally (e.g., `/data/HunyuanImage-3`). This path is mounted read-only into the container.

2. **Build the Image**

```bash
# Optional performance flags
export INSTALL_FLASH_ATTN=false
export INSTALL_FLASH_INFER=false

docker compose build
```

3. **Start the Service**

```bash
# Required: local weights path (170GB)
export MODEL_DIR="/data/HunyuanImage-3"

# Optional overrides
export GPUS="0,1,2,3"
export MODEL_ID="/workspace/models/HunyuanImage-3"
export HOST="0.0.0.0"
export PORT="443"

docker compose up -d
```

The compose file mounts `$MODEL_DIR` to `/workspace/models/HunyuanImage-3` inside the container, exposes `$PORT`, and reserves NVIDIA GPUs via `deploy.resources.reservations.devices`.

4. **Stop the Service**

```bash
docker compose down
```

**Validate & Monitor**

- Check the rendered configuration: `docker compose config`
- Tail logs after startup: `docker compose logs -f`

## 📝 Prompt Guide

### Manually Writing Prompts.
The Pretrain Checkpoint does not automatically rewrite or enhance input prompts, Instruct Checkpoint can rewrite or enhance input prompts with thinking . For optimal results currently, we recommend community partners consulting our official guide on how to write effective prompts.

Reference: [HunyuanImage 3.0 Prompt Handbook](
https://docs.qq.com/doc/DUVVadmhCdG9qRXBU)


### System Prompt For Automatic Rewriting the Prompt.

We've included two system prompts in the PE folder of this repository that leverage DeepSeek to automatically enhance user inputs:

* **system_prompt_universal**: This system prompt converts photographic style, artistic prompts into a detailed one.
* **system_prompt_text_rendering**: This system prompt converts UI/Poster/Text Rending prompts to a deailed on that suits the model.

Note that these system prompts are in Chinese because Deepseek works better with Chinese system prompts. If you want to use it for English oriented model, you may translate it into English or refer to the comments in the PE file as a guide.

We also create a [Yuanqi workflow](https://yuanqi.tencent.com/agent/H69VgtJdj3Dz) to implent the universal one, you can directly try it.

### Advanced Tips
- **Content Priority**: Focus on describing the main subject and action first, followed by details about the environment and style. A more general description framework is: **Main subject and scene + Image quality and style + Composition and perspective + Lighting and atmosphere + Technical parameters**. Keywords can be added both before and after this structure.

- **Image resolution**: Our model not only supports multiple resolutions but also offers both **automatic and specified resolution** options. In auto mode, the model automatically predicts the image resolution based on the input prompt. In specified mode (like traditional DiT), the model outputs an image resolution that strictly aligns with the user's chosen resolution.

### More Cases
Our model can follow complex instructions to generate high‑quality, creative images.

<div align="center">

Our model can effectively process very long text inputs, enabling users to precisely control the finer details of generated images. Extended prompts allow for intricate elements to be accurately captured, making it ideal for complex projects requiring precision and creativity.

A cinematic medium shot captures a single Asian woman seated on a chair within a dimly lit room, creating an intimate and theatrical atmosphere. The composition is focused on the subject, rendered with rich colors and intricate textures that evoke a nostalgic and moody feeling.\n\nThe primary subject is a young Asian woman with a thoughtful and expressive countenance, her gaze directed slightly away from the camera. She is seated in a relaxed yet elegant posture on an ornate, vintage armchair. The chair is upholstered in a deep red velvet, its fabric showing detailed, intricate textures and slight signs of wear. She wears a simple, elegant dress in a dark teal hue, the material catching the light in a way that reveals its fine-woven texture. Her skin has a soft, matte quality, and the light delicately models the contours of her face and arms.\n\nThe surrounding room is characterized by its vintage decor, which contributes to the historic and evocative mood. In the immediate background, partially blurred due to a shallow depth of field consistent with a f/2.8 aperture, the wall is covered with wallpaper featuring a subtle, damask pattern. The overall color palette is a carefully balanced interplay of deep teal and rich red hues, creating a visually compelling and cohesive environment. The entire scene is detailed, from the fibers of the upholstery to the subtle patterns on the wall.\n\nThe lighting is highly dramatic and artistic, defined by high contrast and pronounced shadow play. A single key light source, positioned off-camera, projects gobo lighting patterns onto the scene, casting intricate shapes of light and shadow across the woman and the back wall. These dramatic shadows create a strong sense of depth and a theatrical quality. While some shadows are deep and defined, others remain soft, gently wrapping around the subject and preventing the loss of detail in darker areas. The soft focus on the background enhances the intimate feeling, drawing all attention to the expressive subject. The overall image presents a cinematic, photorealistic photography style.

A cinematic, photorealistic medium shot captures a high-contrast urban street corner, defined by the sharp intersection of light and shadow. The primary subject is the exterior corner of a building, rendered in a low-saturation, realistic style.\n\nThe building wall, which occupies the majority of the frame, is painted a warm orange with a finely detailed, rough stucco texture. Horizontal white stripes run across its surface. The base of the building is constructed from large, rough-hewn stone blocks, showing visible particles and texture. On the left, illuminated side of the building, there is a single window with closed, dark-colored shutters. Adjacent to the window, a simple black pendant lamp hangs from a thin, taut rope, casting a distinct, sharp-edged shadow onto the sunlit orange wall. The composition is split diagonally, with the right side of the building enveloped in a deep brown shadow. At the bottom of the frame, a smooth concrete sidewalk is visible, upon which the dynamic silhouette of a person is captured mid-stride, walking from right to left.\n\nIn the shallow background, the faint, out-of-focus outlines of another building and the bare, skeletal branches of trees are softly visible, contributing to the quiet urban atmosphere and adding a sense of depth to the scene. These elements are rendered with minimal detail to keep the focus on the foreground architecture.\n\nThe scene is illuminated by strong, natural sunlight originating from the upper left, creating a dramatic chiaroscuro effect. This hard light source casts deep, well-defined shadows, producing a sharp contrast between the brightly lit warm orange surfaces and the deep brown shadow areas. The lighting highlights the fine details in the wall texture and stone particles, emphasizing the photorealistic quality. The overall presentation reflects a high-quality photorealistic photography style, infused with a cinematic film noir aesthetic.

由一个两行两列的网格构成，共包含四个独立的场景，每个场景都以不同的艺术风格描绘了一个小男孩（小明）一天中的不同活动。\n\n左上角的第一个场景，以超写实摄影风格呈现。画面主体是一个大约8岁的东亚小男孩，他穿着整洁的小学制服——一件白色短袖衬衫和蓝色短裤，脖子上系着红领巾。他背着一个蓝色的双肩书包，正走在去上学的路上。他位于画面的前景偏右侧，面带微笑，步伐轻快。场景设定在清晨，柔和的阳光从左上方照射下来，在人行道上投下清晰而柔和的影子。背景是绿树成荫的街道和模糊可见的学校铁艺大门，营造出宁静的早晨氛围。这张图片的细节表现极为丰富，可以清晰地看到男孩头发的光泽、衣服的褶皱纹理以及书包的帆布材质，完全展现了专业摄影的质感。\n\n右上角的第二个场景，采用日式赛璐璐动漫风格绘制。画面中，小男孩坐在家中的木质餐桌旁吃午饭。他的形象被动漫化，拥有大而明亮的眼睛和简洁的五官线条。他身穿一件简单的黄色T恤，正用筷子夹起碗里的米饭。桌上摆放着一碗汤和两盘家常菜。背景是一个温馨的室内环境，一扇明亮的窗户透进正午的阳光，窗外是蓝天白云。整个画面色彩鲜艳、饱和度高，角色轮廓线清晰明确，阴影部分采用平涂的色块处理，是典型的赛璐璐动漫风格。\n\n左下角的第三个场景，以细腻的铅笔素描风格呈现。画面描绘了下午在操场上踢足球的小男孩。整个图像由不同灰度的石墨色调构成，没有其他颜色。小男孩身穿运动短袖和短裤，身体呈前倾姿态，右脚正要踢向一个足球，动作充满动感。背景是空旷的操场和远处的球门，用简练的线条和排线勾勒。艺术家通过交叉排线和涂抹技巧来表现光影和体积感，足球上的阴影、人物身上的肌肉线条以及地面粗糙的质感都通过铅笔的笔触得到了充分的展现。这张铅笔画突出了素描的光影关系和线条美感。\n\n右下角的第四个场景，以文森特·梵高的后印象派油画风格进行诠释。画面描绘了夜晚时分，小男孩独自在河边钓鱼的景象。他坐在一块岩石上，手持一根简易的钓鱼竿，身影在深蓝色的夜幕下显得很渺小。整个画面的视觉焦点是天空和水面，天空布满了旋转、卷曲的星云，星星和月亮被描绘成巨大、发光的光团，使用了厚涂的油画颜料（Impasto），笔触粗犷而充满能量。深蓝、亮黄和白色的颜料在画布上相互交织，形成强烈的视觉冲击力。水面倒映着天空中扭曲的光影，整个场景充满了梵高作品中特有的强烈情感和动荡不安的美感。这幅画作是对梵高风格的深度致敬。

## 📊 Evaluation

* 🤖 **SSAE (Machine Evaluation)**   
SSAE (Structured Semantic Alignment Evaluation) is an intelligent evaluation metric for image-text alignment based on advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We extracted 3500 key points across 12 categories, then used multimodal large language models to automatically evaluate and score by comparing the generated images with these key points based on the visual content of the images. Mean Image Accuracy represents the image-wise average score across all key points, while Global Accuracy directly calculates the average score across all key points.

* 👥 **GSB (Human Evaluation)** 

We adopted the GSB (Good/Same/Bad) evaluation method commonly used to assess the relative performance between two models from an overall image perception perspective. In total, we utilized 1,000 text prompts, generating an equal number of image samples for all compared models in a single run. For a fair comparison, we conducted inference only once for each prompt, avoiding any cherry-picking of results. When comparing with the baseline methods, we maintained the default settings for all selected models. The evaluation was performed by more than 100 professional evaluators.
